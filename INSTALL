Installation Instructions
=========================

Varnish
-------

The source tree is based on autotools to configure the building, and does also
have the necessary bits in place to do functional unit tests using the
varnishtest tool.

You need to download Varnish source code and build it locally. It is needed for
varnishtest invocation. Download the appropriate Varnish 3 source tarball
(http://repo.varnish-cache.org/source/) and extract it somewhere on your disk
(eg. /usr/src/).

Build Varnish:

cd /usr/src/varnish-3.0.x/
./autogen.sh
./configure
make

libvmod-querystring
-------------------

Once you have a Varnish build, the libvmod-querystring module can then be built:

cd /path/to/git/repository
./autogen.sh
./configure VARNISHSRC=/usr/src/varnish-3.0.x/ [VMODDIR=`DIR`]
make
sudo make install

`VARNISHSRC` is the directory of the Varnish source tree for which to
compile your vmod. Both the `VARNISHSRC` and `VARNISHSRC/include`
will be added to the include search paths for your module.

Optionally you can also set the vmod install directory by adding
`VMODDIR=DIR` (defaults to the pkg-config discovered directory from your
Varnish installation).

Make targets:

* make - builds the vmod
* make install - installs your vmod in `VMODDIR`
* make check - runs the tests in `src/tests/*.vtc`

RPM packages
------------

Instead of a manual installation, you can build RPM packages from the source.
You need two source tarballs in your rpmbuild `SOURCES` directory. Download the
appropriate Varnish 3 source tarball (http://repo.varnish-cache.org/source/) and
put it with the libvmod-querystring tarball in the `SOURCES` directory. Since
the 0.2 release, it is possible to make the tarball from the git repository:

cd /path/to/git/repository
./dist.sh 0.2
mv libvmod-querystring-0.2.tar.gz /path/to/rpmbuild/SOURCES/
rpmbuild -bb --define 'VARNISHVER 3.0.x' redhat/vmod-querystring.spec
